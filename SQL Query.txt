SELECT city,avg(marks)FROM student GROUP BY city ORDER BY avg(marks)DESC;

Que)for the given table find the total payment according to each payment method.

SELECT mode,count(customer)FROM payment GROUP BY mode

Having clause:
----------------
SELECT count(name),city from student GROUP BY city HAVING max(marks)>90;

General Order:
--------------
